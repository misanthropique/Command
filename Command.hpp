/**
 * A management class for executing other applications
 * without all the hassle of having to write the same code repeatedly.
 *
 * If you're looking to set up a pipe, I'd recommend creating a vector
 * of Command objects and then using the redirect*() methods to set the
 * STD(OUT|ERR) of the nth command to the STDIN of the nth + 1 command.
 *
 * At the moment a 1-to-many (for std(out|err) to many stdin) is not needed
 * any where, but should the occasion arise I can integrate that behaviour
 * at a later point in time.
